				<br>	
				In this village, a remarkable deity has emerged naturally, and we reverently call him "Halkere Shri Batte Vinayaka." The deity's manifestation has been a marvel to behold, as this divine figure emerged on its own in our village. The name "Halkere Shri Batte Vinayaka" has become synonymous with this miraculous occurrence, and the local community holds deep reverence for this deity. The awe-inspiring presence of "Halkere Shri Batte Vinayaka" has captivated the hearts and minds of the villagers, and it has become a cherished symbol of faith and devotion in our village.

				<span id = "IMP">The birth story of this deity is fascinating.</span>
				<br>
				Just like in every village, the villagers here used to release their cattle every morning to allow them to access fresh pastures for grazing. In this group of cattle, there was one cow that used to drop milk over a stone in the forest. The owner of that cow didn't get any milk for a few days, and he suspected that the cowboy who took care of the cattle was secretly drinking the milk from the cow in the forest.

				To clear the allegations, the cowboy decided to secretly follow that particular cow, and to his amazement, he noticed that the cow was actually dropping milk on the stone on its own. The cowboy then informed all the villagers about this incredible phenomenon, and when they witnessed it themselves, they were astonished.

				Another remarkable fact is that as the days passed, the stone started to grow, and a face of Lord Ganapathi began to take shape on that stone. This miraculous event led the villagers to start worshipping the stone as an idol of Lord Ganapathi and they eventually built a temple around it.
				<br>
				Now, what was once just a stone has transformed into a revered idol of Lord Ganapathi, all because of the miraculous events that unfolded in this village.
